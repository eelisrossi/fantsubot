## What does this bot do?

Well, the idea for the bot is to be able to do most things one would need from a discord bot.  
I wanted to make a bot for my own server, that would function the way __I__ wanted it to function.  
Therefore, most of the functionality will be what I happend to need or want at the time of making this.  
This is also my first real project outside of university, so its also made for learning and becoming familiar with stuff.
